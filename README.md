## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of an interactive **Call Centre Performance Dashboard** that highlights critical metrics such as call volumes, agent performance, customer satisfaction, and revenue analysis. The dashboard is built using advanced Excel functionalities to showcase data analysis and visualization skills relevant to real-world data analytics tasks.

### Key Features:

- **Interactive Dashboard**: A professional call center performance dashboard with dynamic elements like slicers and pivot charts to filter data in real-time.
- **KPI Calculation**: Using **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions) and **Power Pivot** to create Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as average call handling time, customer satisfaction scores, and total revenue per agent.
- **Data Modeling**: Utilized Excel's **Data Model** to connect multiple datasets, ensuring efficient analysis through relationships between tables.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Developed interactive **Pivot Charts**, trendline graphs, and tables to visualize key trends such as call volume by weekday, agent performance, and demographic distribution.
- **Conditional Formatting**: Applied conditional formatting to highlight important data points and trends in charts and tables, providing clear visual insights.
- **Dynamic Content**: Integrated **XLOOKUP** and images to show dynamic content such as representative pictures based on the selected agent or rep.
